# Discovering the Bacterial Biodiversity in Belly Buttons

## Overview of Project
This project aims to characterize and identify the bacterial species on our belly buttons and harness their power for other innovations. One such innovation prompted the partnership with ImprobableBeef, a start-up that is interested in discovering bacteria that can help them on their quest to sustainable food production in the laboratory. 

As part of this project, a large cohort of people had their belly buttons sampled and the bacterial species were cultured, determined and logged into a JSON file. Subsequently, the data was visualized by Plotly charts and displayed on an HTML page, with customizations using Bootstrap 3. This webpage allows for subjects part of the project to view individual profiles and bacterial results using their subject ID.
